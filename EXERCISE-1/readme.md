# Car Rental Records Project

This project demonstrates basic Python data structures and operations in the context of a car rental business. The code is organized into several tasks, each focusing on a different data type or concept.

## Features

- **Task 1: Integers**
  - Calculates total, average, minimum, and maximum rent costs from a list of integers.

- **Task 2: Strings**
  - Prints a summary report using string formatting.

- **Task 3: Booleans**
  - Checks if the average rent cost and maximum rent cost meet specified thresholds.

- **Task 4: Lists**
  - Demonstrates list operations: appending, filtering, and sorting rent days.

- **Task 5: Arrays**
  - Uses the `array` module to store rent costs and compares sums with the list version.

- **Task 6: Dictionaries**
  - Manages a list of car rental records as dictionaries.
  - Demonstrates updating, deleting, and calculating totals from dictionary data.

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Run the script:

   ```powershell
   python index.py
   ```

## File Structure

- `index.py` - Main script containing all tasks and logic.

## Example Output

The script prints results for each task, such as:

- Rent costs statistics
- Summary reports
- Boolean checks for thresholds
- List manipulations
- Array operations
- Dictionary updates and totals
